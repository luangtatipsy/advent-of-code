## Introduction
This repository contains all my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). The purpose of creating the repo is to store all of the solutions being done in a single place.

## Setup
1. Create and activate a virtual environment for Python _(recommended)_. If you do not prefer using a virtual environment, skip to step 4.
```sh
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```
2. Update pip to latest version
```sh
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
3. Install requirements
```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run tests
```sh
python -m pytest --cache-clear --cov=./aoc_{2019,2020,2021} --cov-report=xml tests/
```
